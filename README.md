# Image Classification with LeNet-5

## Overview
This repository demonstrates image classification using the LeNet-5 architecture on two common datasets. The project includes loading datasets, performing necessary pre-processing, training the LeNet-5 model, and evaluating its performance.

## Key Features
1. **Datasets:**
   - Utilizes two common datasets for image classification:
     - MNIST dataset.
     - CIFAR-10 dataset.

2. **Pre-processing:**
   - Applies relevant pre-processing functions to analyze and prepare the datasets for classification.

3. **LeNet-5 Implementation:**
   - Utilizes the LeNet-5 architecture to accomplish image classification tasks.

4. **Evaluation Metrics:**
   - Generates a confusion matrix for testing samples
   - Calculate precision, recall, and F1 score

5. **Results Commentary:**
   - Explore the results from the code and comments
